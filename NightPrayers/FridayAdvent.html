                    Hail, holy Queen, mother of mercy,<br>
                    our life, our sweetness, and our hope.<br>
                    To you do we cry,<br>
                    poor banished children of Eve.<br>
                    To you do we send up our sighs<br>
                    mourning and weeping in this vale of tears.<br>
                    Turn then, most gracious advocate,<br>
                    your eyes of mercy toward us,<br>
                    and after this exile<br>
                    show us the blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus.<br>
                    O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.<br>
